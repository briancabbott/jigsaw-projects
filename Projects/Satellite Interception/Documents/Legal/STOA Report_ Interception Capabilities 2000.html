    </UL>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>1. <B>Communications intelligence</B> (Comint)
involving the covert interception of foreign communications has been practised
by almost every advanced nation since international telecommunications became
available. Comint is a large-scale industrial activity providing consumers
with intelligence on diplomatic, economic and scientific developments. The
capabilities of and constraints on Comint activity may usefully be considered
in the framework of the "intelligence cycle" (section 1).</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>2. Globally, about 15-20 billion Euro is
expended annually on Comint and related activities. The largest component
of this expenditure is incurred by the major English-speaking nations of
the UKUSA
alliance.</FONT></FONT><B><A href="#N_1_">(1)</A></B><FONT face="Arial"><FONT
    size=-1> This report describes how Comint organisations have for more than
80 years made arrangements to obtain access to much of the world's international
communications. These include the unauthorised interception of commercial
satellites, of long distance communications from space, of undersea cables
using submarines, and of the Internet. In excess of 120 satellite systems
are currently in simultaneous operation collecting intelligence (section
2).</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>3. The highly automated UKUSA system for
processing Comint, often known as ECHELON, has been widely discussed within
Europe following a 1997 STOA
report.</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_2_"><B>(</B>2<B>)</B></A><FONT face="Arial"><FONT
    size=-1> That report summarised information from the only two primary sources
then available on
ECHELON.</FONT></FONT><B><A href="#N_3_">(3)</A></B><FONT face="Arial"><FONT
    size=-1> This report provides original new documentary and other evidence
about the ECHELON system and its involvement in the interception of communication
satellites (section 3). A technical annexe give a supplementary, detailed
description of Comint processing methods.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>4. Comint information derived from the
interception of international communications has long been routinely used
to obtain sensitive data concerning individuals, governments, trade and
international organisations. This report sets out the organisational and
reporting frameworks within which economically sensitive information is collected
and disseminated, summarising examples where European commercial organisations
have been the subject of surveillance (section 4).</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>5. This report identifies a previously unknown
international organisation - "ILETS" - which has, without parliamentary or
public discussion or awareness, put in place contentious plans to require
manufacturers and operators of new communications systems to build in monitoring
capacity for use by national security or law enforcement organisations (section
5).</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>6. Comint organisations now perceive that
the technical difficulties of collecting communications are increasing, and
that future production may be costlier and more limited than at present.
The perception of such difficulties may provide a useful basis for policy
options aimed at protective measures concerning economic information and
effective encryption (section 6).</FONT></FONT>

of the art in Comint include :</FONT></FONT>

    <UL>
      <LI>
	<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>Comprehensive systems exist to access, intercept
	and process every important modern form of communications, with few exceptions
	(section 2, technical annexe);</FONT></FONT>
      <LI>
	<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>Contrary to reports in the press, effective
	"word spotting" search systems automatically to select telephone calls of
	intelligence interest are not yet available, despite 30 years of research.
	However, speaker recognition systems - in effect, "voiceprints" - have been
	developed and are deployed to recognise the speech of targeted individuals
	making international telephone calls;</FONT></FONT>
      <LI>
	<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>Recent diplomatic initiatives by the United
	States government seeking European agreement to the "key escrow" system of
	cryptography masked intelligence collection requirements, and formed part
	of a long-term program which has undermined and continues to undermine the
	communications privacy of non-US nationals, including European governments,
	companies and citizens;</FONT></FONT>
      <LI>
	<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>There is wide-ranging evidence indicating
	that major governments are routinely utilising communications intelligence
	to provide commercial advantage to companies and trade.</FONT></FONT>

</UL>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>1. Communications intelligence (Comint)
is defined by NSA, the largest agency conducting such operations as "technical
and intelligence information derived from foreign communications by other
than their intended recipient".
</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_4_">(4)</A><FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>Comint
is a major component of Sigint (signals intelligence), which also includes
the collection of non-communications signals, such as radar
emissions.</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_5_">(5)</A><FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>
Although this report deals with agencies and systems whose overall task may
be Sigint, it is concerned only with Comint.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>2. Comint has shadowed the development of
extensive high capacity new civil telecommunications systems, and has in
consequence become a large-scale industrial activity employing many skilled
workers and utilising exceptionally high degrees of automation.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>3. The targets of Comint operations are
varied. The most traditional Comint targets are military messages and diplomatic
communications between national capitals and missions abroad. Since the 1960s,
following the growth of world trade, the collection of economic intelligence
and information about scientific and technical developments has been an
increasingly important aspect of Comint. More recent targets include narcotics
trafficking, money laundering, terrorism and organised crime.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>4. Whenever access to international
communications channels is obtained for one purpose, access to every other
type of communications carried on the same channels is automatic, subject
only to the tasking requirements of agencies. Thus, for example, NSA and
its British counterpart GCHQ, used Comint collected primarily for other purposes
to provide data about domestic political opposition figures in the United
States between 1967 and 1975.</FONT></FONT>

<FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>5. The United States Sigint System
(USSS) consists of the National Security Agency (NSA), military support units
collectively called the Central Security Service, and parts of the CIA and
other organisations. Following wartime collaboration, in 1947 the UK and
the US made a secret agreement to continue to conduct collaborative global
Comint activities. Three other English-speaking nations, Canada, Australia
and New Zealand joined the UKUSA agreement as "Second Parties". The UKUSA
agreement was not acknowledged publicly until March 1999, when the Australian
government confirmed that its Sigint organisation, Defence Signals Directorate
(DSD) "does co-operate with counterpart signals intelligence organisations
overseas under the UKUSA relationship".<A href="#N_6_">(6)</A> The UKUSA
agreement shares facilities, tasks and product between participating
governments.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>6. Although UKUSA Comint agency staffs and
budgets have shrunk following the end of the cold war, they have reaffirmed
their requirements for access to all the world's communications. Addressing
NSA staff on his departure in 1992, then NSA director Admiral William Studeman
described how "the demands for increased global access are growing". The
"business area" of "global access" was, he said, one of "two, hopefully strong,
legs upon which NSA must stand" in the next
century.</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_7_">(7)</A>

has been constrained by recognisable industrial features, including the
requirement to match budgets and capabilities to customer requirements. The
multi-step process by means of which communications intelligence is sought,
collected, processed and passed on is similar for all countries, and is often
described as the "intelligence cycle". The steps of the intelligence cycle
correspond to distinct organisational and technical features of Comint
production. Thus, for example, the administration of NSA's largest field
station in the world, at Menwith Hill in England and responsible for operating
over 250 classified projects, is divided into three directorates: OP, Operations
and Plans; CP, Collection Processing; and EP, Exploitation and
Production<B>.</B></FONT></FONT>

<P>
<FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>9. Planning first involves determining
customer requirements. Customers include the major ministries of the sponsoring
government - notably those concerned with defence, foreign affairs, security,
trade and home affairs. The overall management of Comint involves the
identification of requirements for data as well as translating requirements
into potentially achievable tasks, prioritising, arranging analysis and
reporting, and monitoring the quality of Comint product.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>10. Once targets have been selected,
specific existing or new collection capabilities may be tasked, based on
the type of information required, the susceptibility of the targeted activity
to collection, and the likely effectiveness of collection.</FONT></FONT>

    and collection</FONT></FONT></B>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>11. The first essential of Comint
is access to the desired communications medium so that communications may
be intercepted. Historically, where long-range radio communications were
used, this task was simple. Some important modern communications systems
are not "Comint friendly" and may require unusual, expensive or intrusive
methods to gain access. The physical means of communication is usually
independent of the type of information carried. For example, inter-city microwave
radio-relay systems, international satellite links and fibre optic submarine
cables will all usually carry mixed traffic of television, telephone, fax,
data links, private voice, video and data.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>12. Collection follows interception, but
is a distinct activity in that many types of signals may be intercepted but
will receive no further processing save perhaps technical searches to verify
that communications patterns remain unchanged. For example, a satellite
interception station tasked to study a newly launched communications satellite
will set up an antenna to intercept all that the satellite sends to the ground.
Once a survey has established which parts of the satellite's signals carry,
say, television or communications of no interest, these signals will not
progress further within the system.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>13. Collection includes both acquiring
information by interception and passing information of interest downstream
for processing and production. Because of the high information rates used
in many modern networks, and the complexity of the signals within them, it
is now common for high speed recorders or "snapshot" memories temporarily
to hold large quantities of data while processing takes place. Modern collection
activities use secure, rapid communications to pass data via global networks
to human analysts who may be a continent away. Selecting messages for collection
and processing is in most cases automated, involving large on-line databanks
holding information about targets of interest.</FONT></FONT>
<UL>
  <LI>

</UL>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>14. Processing is the conversion
of collected information into a form suitable for analysis or the production
of intelligence, either automatically or under human supervision. Incoming
communications are normally converted into standard formats identifying their
technical characteristics, together with message (or signal) related information
(such as the telephone numbers of the parties to a telephone
conversation).</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>15. At an early stage, if it is not inherent
in the selection of the message or conversation, each intercepted signal
or channel will be described in standard "case notation". Case notation first
identifies the countries whose communications have been intercepted, usually
by two letters. A third letter designates the general class of communications:
C for commercial carrier intercepts, D for diplomatic messages, P for police
channels, etc. A fourth letter designates the type of communications system
(such as S for multi-channel). Numbers then designate particular links or
networks. Thus for example, during the 1980s NSA intercepted and processed
traffic designated as "FRD" (French diplomatic) from Chicksands, England,
while the British Comint agency GCHQ deciphered "ITD" (Italian diplomatic)
messages at its Cheltenham headquarters.
</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_9_">(9)</A>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>16. Processing may also involve translation
or "gisting" (replacing a verbatim text with the sense or main points of
a communication). Translation and gisting can to some degree be
automated.</FONT></FONT>

</UL>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>17. Comint production involves
analysis, evaluation, translation and interpretation of raw data into finished
intelligence. The final step of the intelligence cycle is dissemination,
meaning the passing of reports to the intelligence consumers. Such reports
can consist of raw (but decrypted and/or translated) messages, gists, commentary,
or extensive analyses. The quality and relevance of the disseminated reports
lead in turn to the re-specification of intelligence collection priorities,
thereby completing the intelligence cycle.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>18. The nature of dissemination is highly
significant to questions of how Comint is exploited to obtain economic advantage.
Comint activities everywhere are highly classified because, it is argued,
knowledge of the success of interception would be likely to lead targets
to change their communications methods to defeat future interception. Within
the UKUSA system, the dissemination of Comint reports is limited to individuals
holding high-level security "SCI"
clearances.</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_10_">(10)</A><FONT face="Arial"><FONT
    size=-1> Further, because only cleared officials can see Comint reports,
only they can set requirements and thus control tasking. Officials of commercial
companies normally neither have clearance nor routine access to Comint, and
may therefore only benefit from commercially relevant Comint information
to the extent that senior, cleared government officials permit. The ways
in which this takes place is described in Section 5, below.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>19. Dissemination is further restricted
within the UKUSA organisation by national and international rules generally
stipulating that the Sigint agencies of each nation may not normally collect
or (if inadvertently collected) record or disseminate information about citizens
of, or companies registered in, any other UKUSA nation. Citizens and companies
are collectively known as "legal persons". The opposite procedure is followed
if the person concerned has been targeted by their national Comint
organisation.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>20. For example, Hager has described
</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_11_">(11)</A><FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>
how New Zealand officials were instructed to remove the names of identifiable
UKUSA citizens or companies from their reports, inserting instead words such
as "a Canadian citizen" or "a US company". British Comint staff have described
following similar procedures in respect of US citizens following the introduction
of legislation to limit NSA's domestic intelligence activities in
1978.</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_12_">(12)</A><FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>
The Australian government says that "DSD and its counterparts operate internal
procedures to satisfy themselves that their national interests and policies
are respected by the others ... the Rules [on Sigint and Australian persons]
prohibit the dissemination of information relating to Australian persons
gained accidentally during the course of routine collection of foreign
communications; or the reporting or recording of the names of Australian
persons mentioned in foreign
communications".</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_13_">(13)</A><FONT face="Arial"><FONT
    size=-1> The corollary is also true; UKUSA nations place no restrictions
on intelligence gathering affecting either citizens or companies of any non-UKUSA
nation, including member states of the European Union (except the
UK).</FONT></FONT> <BR>

low power transmitters and parabolic dish antennae placed on towers in high

<FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>25. Microwave radio signals are
not reflected from the ionosphere and pass directly into space. This property
has been exploited both to provide global communications and, conversely,
to intercept such communications in space and on land. The largest constellation
of communications satellites (COMSATs) is operated by the International
Telecommunications Satellite organisation (Intelsat), an international treaty
organisation. To provide permanent communications from point to point or
for broadcasting purposes, communications satellites are placed into so-called
"geostationary" orbits such that, to the earth-based observer, they appear
to maintain the same position in the sky.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT size=-1>26. The first geostationary Intelsat
satellites were orbited in 1967. Satellite technology developed rapidly.
The fourth generation of Intelsat satellites, introduced in 1971, provided
capacity for 4,000 simulataneous telephone channels and were capable of handling
all forms of communications simultaneously -telephone, telex, telegraph,
television, data and facsimile. In 1999, Intelsat operated 19 satellites

<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>32. The most advanced type of HF monitoring
system deployed during this period for Comint purposes was a large circular
antenna array known as AN/FLR-9. AN/FLR-9 antennae are more than 400 metres
in diameter. They can simultaneously intercept and determine the bearing
of signals from as many directions and on as many frequencies as may be desired.
In 1964, AN/FLR-9 receiving systems were installed at San Vito dei Normanni,
Italy; Chicksands, England, and Karamursel, Turkey.</FONT></FONT>

<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>33. In August 1966, NSA transferred ILC
collection activities from its Scottish site at Kirknewton, to Menwith Hill
in England. Ten years later, this activity was again transferred, to Chicksands.
Although the primary function of the Chicksands site was to intercept Soviet
and Warsaw Pact air force communications, it was also tasked to collect ILC
and "NDC" (Non-US Diplomatic Communications). Prominent among such tasks
was the collection of FRD traffic (i.e., French diplomatic communications).
Although most personnel at Chicksands were members of the US Air Force,
diplomatic and ILC interception was handled by civilian NSA employees in
a unit called DODJOCC.</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_17_">(17)</A>

relay links may require dozens of intermediate stations to receive and
re-transmit communications. Each subsequent receiving station picks up only
a tiny fraction of the original transmitted signal; the remainder passes
over the horizon and on into space, where satellites can collect it. These
principles were exploited during the 1960s to provide Comint collection from

such satellites is not above the chosen target, but up to 80 degrees of longitude

<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>36. The first US Comint satellite, CANYON,
was launched In August 1968, followed soon by a second. The satellites were
controlled from a ground station at Bad Aibling, Germany. In order to provide
permanent coverage of selected targets, CANYON satellites were placed close
to geostationary orbits. However, the orbits were not exact, causing the
satellites to change position and obtain more data on ground
targets.</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_20_">(20)</A><FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>
Seven CANYON satellites were launched between 1968 and 1977.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>37. CANYON's target was the Soviet Union.
Major Soviet communications links extended for thousands of miles, much of
it over Siberia, where permafrost restricted the reliable use of underground
cables. Geographical circumstances thus favoured NSA by making Soviet internal
communications links highly accessible. The satellites performed better than
expected, so the project was extended.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>38. The success of CANYON led to the design
and deployment of a new class of Comint satellites, CHALET. The ground station
chosen for the CHALET series was Menwith Hill, England. Under NSA project
P-285, US companies were contracted to install and assist in operating the
satellite control system and downlinks (RUNWAY) and ground processing system
(SILKWORTH). The first two CHALET satellites were launched in June 1978 and
October 1979. After the name of the first satellite appeared in the US press,
they were renamed VORTEX. In 1982, NSA obtained approval for expanded "new
mission requirements" and were given funds and facilities to operate four
VORTEX satellites simultaneously. A new 5,000m<SUP>2</SUP> operations centre
(STEEPLEBUSH) was constructed to house processing equipment. When the name
VORTEX was published in 1987, the satellites were renamed
MERCURY.</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_21_">(21)</A>

Sigint satellites launched after 1990 remain obscure, it is apparent from
observation of the relevant ground centres that collection systems have expanded
rather than contracted. The main stations are at Buckley Field, Denver, Colorado;
Pine Gap, Australia; Menwith Hill, England; and Bad Aibling, Germany. The
satellites and their processing facilities are exceptionally costly (of the
order of $1 billion US each). In 1998, the US National Reconnaissance Office
(NRO) announced plans to combine the three separate classes of Sigint satellites
into an Integrated Overhead Sigint Architecture (IOSA) in order to " improve

simultaneously from all parts of the globe suggest strongly that the tasking
of these satellites will be directed towards the highest priority national
and military targets. Thus, although European communications passing on
inter-city microwave routes can be collected, it is likely that they are
normally ignored. But it is very highly probable that communications to or
from Europe and which pass through the microwave communications networks
of Middle Eastern states are collected and processed.</FONT></FONT>

<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>45. Systematic collection of COMSAT ILC
communications began in 1971. Two ground stations were built for this purpose.
The first at Morwenstow, Cornwall, England had two 30-metre antennae. One
intercepted communications from the Atlantic Ocean Intelsat; the other the
Indian Ocean Intelsat. The second Intelsat interception site was at Yakima,
Washington in the northwestern United States. NSA's "Yakima Research Station"
intercepted communications passing through the Pacific Ocean Intelsat
satellite.</FONT></FONT>

western-run communications satellites remained at this level until the late
1970s, when a second US site at Sugar Grove, West Virginia was added to the
network. By 1980, its three satellite antenna had been reassigned to the
US Naval Security Group and were used for COMSAT interception. Large-scale
expansion of the ILC satellite interception system took place between 1985
and 1995, in conjunction with the enlargement of the ECHELON processing system
(section 3). New stations were constructed in the United States (Sabana Seca,
Puerto Rico), Canada (Leitrim, Ontario), Australia (Kojarena, Western Australia)
and New Zealand (Waihopai, South Island). Capacity at Yakima, Morwenstow

</UL>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>48. Submarine cables now play a dominant
role in international telecommunications, since - in contrast to the limited
bandwidth available for space systems - optical media offer seemingly unlimited
capacity. Save where cables terminate in countries where telecommunications
operators provide Comint access (such as the UK and the US), submarine cables
appear intrinsically secure because of the nature of the ocean
environment.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>49. In October 1971, this security was shown
not to exist. A US submarine, Halibut, visited the Sea of Okhotsk off the
eastern USSR and recorded communications passing on a military cable to the
Khamchatka Peninsula. Halibut was equipped with a deep diving chamber, fully
in view on the submarine's stern. The chamber was described by the US Navy
as a "deep submergence rescue vehicle". The truth was that the "rescue vehicle"
was welded immovably to the submarine. Once submerged, deep-sea divers exited
the submarine and wrapped tapping coils around the cable. Having proven the
principle, USS Halibut returned in 1972 and laid a high capacity recording
pod next to the cable. The technique involved no physical damage and was
unlikely to have been readily
detectable.</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_29_">(29)</A>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>50. The Okhotsk cable tapping operation
continued for ten years, involving routine trips by three different specially
equipped submarines to collect old pods and lay new ones; sometimes, more
than one pod at a time. New targets were added in 1979. That summer, a newly
converted submarine called USS Parche travelled from San Francisco under
the North Pole to the Barents Sea, and laid a new cable tap near Murmansk.
Its crew received a presidential citation for their achievement. The Okhotsk
cable tap ended in 1982, after its location was compromised by a former NSA
employee who sold information about the tap, codenamed IVY BELLS, to the
Soviet Union. One of the IVY BELLS pods is now on display in the Moscow museum
of the former KGB. The cable tap in the Barents Sea continued in operation,
undetected, until tapping stopped in 1992.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>51. During 1985, cable-tapping operations
were extended into the Mediterranean, to intercept cables linking Europe
to West Africa.
</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_30_">(30)</A><FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>
After the cold war ended, the USS Parche was refitted with an extended section
to accommodate larger cable tapping equipment and pods. Cable taps could
be laid by remote control, using drones. USS Parche continues in operation
to the present day, but the precise targets of its missions remain unknown.
The Clinton administration evidently places high value on its achievements,
Every year from 1994 to 1997, the submarine crew has been highly
commended.</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_31_">(31)</A><FONT face="Arial"><FONT
    size=-1> Likely targets may include the Middle East, Mediterranean, eastern
Asia, and South America. The United States is the only naval power known
to have deployed deep-sea technology for this purpose.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>52. Miniaturised inductive taps recorders
have also been used to intercept underground
cables.</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_32_">(32)</A><FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>
Optical fibre cables, however, do not leak radio frequency signals and cannot
be tapped using inductive loops. NSA and other Comint agencies have spent
a great deal of money on research into tapping optical fibres, reportedly
with little success. But long distance optical fibre cables are not invulnerable.
The key means of access is by tampering with optoelectronic "repeaters" which
boost signal levels over long distances. It follows that any submarine cable
system using submerged optoelectronic repeaters cannot be considered secure
from interception and communications intelligence activity.</FONT></FONT>

    the Internet</FONT></FONT></B>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>53. The dramatic growth in the size and
significance of the Internet and of related forms of digital communications
has been argued by some to pose a challenge for Comint agencies. This does
not appear correct. During the 1980s, NSA and its UKUSA partners operated
a larger international communications network than the then Internet but
based on the same
technology.</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_33_">(33)</A><FONT face="Arial"><FONT
    size=-1> According to its British partner "all GCHQ systems are linked together
on the largest LAN [Local Area Network] in Europe, which is connected to
other sites around the world via one of the largest WANs [Wide Area Networks]
in the world ... its main networking protocol is Internet Protocol
(IP).</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_34_">(34)</A><FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>
This global network, developed as project EMBROIDERY, includes PATHWAY, the
NSA's main computer communications network. It provides fast, secure global
communications for ECHELON and other systems.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>54. Since the early 1990s, fast and
sophisticated Comint systems have been developed to collect, filter and analyse
the forms of fast digital communications used by the Internet. Because most
of the world's Internet capacity lies within the United States or connects
to the United States, many communications in "cyberspace" will pass through
intermediate sites within the United States. Communications from Europe to
and from Asia, Oceania, Africa or South America normally travel via the United
States.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>55. Routes taken by Internet "packets" depend
on the origin and destination of the data, the systems through which they
enter and leaves the Internet, and a myriad of other factors including time
of day. Thus, routers within the western United States are at their most
idle at the time when central European traffic is reaching peak usage. It
is thus possible (and reasonable) for messages travelling a short distance
in a busy European network to travel instead, for example, via Internet exchanges
in California. It follows that a large proportion of international communications
on the Internet will by the nature of the system pass through the United
States and thus be readily accessible to NSA.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>56.Standard Internet messages are composed
of packets called "datagrams" . Datagrams include numbers representing both
their origin and their destination, called "IP addresses". The addresses
are unique to each computer connected to the Internet. They are inherently
easy to identify as to country and site of origin and destination. Handling,
sorting and routing millions of such packets each second is fundamental to
the operation of major Internet centres. The same process facilitates extraction
of traffic for Comint purposes.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>57. Internet traffic can be accessed either
from international communications links entering the United States, or when
it reaches major Internet exchanges. Both methods have advantages. Access
to communications systems is likely to be remain clandestine - whereas access
to Internet exchanges might be more detectable but provides easier access
to more data and simpler sorting methods. Although the quantities of data
involved are immense, NSA is normally legally restricted to looking only
at communications that start or finish in a foreign country. Unless special
warrants are issued, all other data should normally be thrown away by machine
before it can be examined or recorded.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>58. Much other Internet traffic (whether
foreign to the US or not) is of trivial intelligence interest or can be handled
in other ways. For example, messages sent to "Usenet" discussion groups amounts
to about 15 Gigabytes (GB) of data per day; the rough equivalent of 10,000
books. All this data is broadcast to anyone wanting (or willing) to have
it. Like other Internet users, intelligence agencies have open source access
to this data and store and analyse it. In the UK, the Defence Evaluation
and Research Agency maintains a 1 Terabyte database containing the previous
90 days of Usenet
messages.</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_35_">(35)</A><FONT face="Arial"><FONT
    size=-1> A similar service, called "Deja News", is available to users of
the World Wide Web (WWW). Messages for Usenet are readily distinguishable.
It is pointless to collect them clandestinely.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>59. Similar considerations affect the World
Wide Web, most of which is openly accessible. Web sites are examined continuously
by "search engines" which generate catalogues of their contents. "Alta Vista"
and "Hotbot" are prominent public sites of this kind. NSA similarly employs
computer "bots" (robots) to collect data of interest. For example, a New
York web site known as JYA.COM (http://www.jya.com/cryptome) offers extensive
public information on Sigint, Comint and cryptography. The site is frequently
updated. Records of access to the site show that every morning it is visited
by a "bot" from NSA's National Computer Security Centre, which looks for
new files and makes copies of any that it
finds.</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_36_">(36)</A>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>60. It follows that foreign Internet traffic
of communications intelligence interest - consisting of e-mail, file transfers,
"virtual private networks" operated over the internet, and some other messages
- will form at best a few per cent of the traffic on most US Internet exchanges
or backbone links. According to a former employee, NSA had by 1995 installed
"sniffer" software to collect such traffic at nine major Internet exchange
points
(IXPs).</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_37_">(37)</A><FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>
The first two such sites identified, FIX East and FIX West, are operated
by US government agencies. They are closely linked to nearby commercial
locations, MAE East and MAE West (see table). Three other sites listed were
Network Access Points originally developed by the US National Science Foundation
to provide the US Internet with its initial "backbone".</FONT></FONT> <BR>

Iridium, uses 66 satellites and started operations in 1998. Iridium appears
to have created particular difficulties for communications intelligence agencies,
since the signals down from the Iridium and similar networks can only be
received in a small area, which may be anywhere on the earth's
surface.</FONT></FONT><A NAME="_Toc448565540"></A> <BR>

<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>66. After the public revelation of the SHAMROCK
interception programme, NSA Director Lt General Lew Allen described how NSA
used "'watch lists" as an aid to watch for foreign activity of reportable
intelligence
interest".</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_41_">(41)</A><FONT face="Arial"><FONT
    size=-1> "We have been providing details ... of any messages contained in
the foreign communications we intercept that bear on named individuals or
organisations. These compilations of names are commonly referred to as 'Watch
Lists'", he
said.</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_42_">(42)</A><FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>
Until the 1970s, Watch List processing was manual. Analysts examined intercepted
ILC communications, reporting, "gisting" or analysing those which appeared
to cover names or topics on the Watch
List.</FONT></FONT><A NAME="_Toc448565542"></A>
<P>
<B><FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>New
information about ECHELON sites and systems</U></FONT></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>67. It now appears that the system identified
as ECHELON has been in existence for more than 20 years. The need for such
a system was foreseen in the late 1960s, when NSA and GCHQ planned ILC satellite
interception stations at Mowenstow and Yakima. It was expected that the quantity
of messages intercepted from the new satellites would be too great for individual
examination. According to former NSA staff, the first ECHELON computers automated
Comint processing at these sites.</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_43_">(43)</A>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>68. NSA and CIA then discovered that Sigint
collection from space was more effective than had been anticipated, resulting
in accumulations of recordings that outstripped the available supply of linguists
and analysts. Documents show that when the SILKWORTH processing systems was
installed at Menwith Hill for the new satellites, it was supported by ECHELON
2 and other databanks (see illustration).</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>69. By the mid 1980s, communications intercepted
at these major stations were heavily sifted, with a wide variety of
specifications available for non-verbal traffic. Extensive further automation
was planned in the mid 1980s as NSA Project P-415. Implementation of this
project completed the automation of the previous Watch List activity. From
1987 onwards, staff from international Comint agencies travelled to the US
to attended training courses for the new computer systems.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>70. Project P-415/ECHELON made heavy use
of NSA and GCHQ's global Internet-like communication network to enable remote
intelligence customers to task computers at each collection site, and receive
the results automatically. The key component of the system are local "Dictionary"
computers, which store an extensive database on specified targets, including
names, topics of interest, addresses, telephone numbers and other selection
criteria. Incoming messages are compared to these criteria; if a match is
found, the raw intelligence is forwarded automatically. Dictionary computers
are tasked with many thousands of different collection requirements, described
as "numbers" (four digit codes).</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>71. Tasking and receiving intelligence from
the Dictionaries involves processes familiar to anyone who has used the Internet.
Dictionary sorting and selection can be compared to using search engines,
which select web pages containing key words or terms and specifying
relationships. The forwarding function of the Dictionary computers may be
compared to e-mail. When requested, the system will provide lists of
communications matching each criterion for review, analysis, "gisting" or
forwarding. An important point about the new system is that before ECHELON,
different countries and different stations knew what was being intercepted
and to whom it was sent. Now, all but a fraction of the messages selected
by Dictionary computers at remote sites are forwarded to NSA or other customers
without being read locally.</FONT></FONT> <BR>

<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>81. Fax messages and computer data (from
modems) are given priority in processing because of the ease with which they
are understood and analysed. The main method of filtering and analysing
non-verbal traffic, the Dictionary computers, utilise traditional information
retrieval techniques, including keywords. Fast special purpose chips enable
vast quantities of data to be processed in this way. The newest technique
is "topic spotting". The processing of telephone calls is mainly limited
to identifying call-related information, and traffic analysis. Effective
voice "wordspotting" systems do not exist are not in use, despite reports
to the contrary. But "voiceprint" type speaker identification systems have
been in use since at least 1995. The use of strong cryptography is slowly
impinging on Comint agencies' capabilities. This difficulty for Comint agencies
has been offset by covert and overt activities which have subverted the
effectiveness of cryptographic systems supplied from and/or used in
Europe.</FONT></FONT>

became concerned that the marketing of a secure telephone system by AT&amp;T
could curtail Comint activity. AT&amp;T was persuaded to withdraw its product.
In its place the US government offered NSA "Clipper" chips for incorporation
in secure phones. The chips would be manufactured by NSA, which would also
record built-in keys and pass this information to other government agencies
for storage and, if required, retrieval. This proposal proved extremely
unpopular, and was abandoned. In its place, the US government proposed that
non government agencies should be required to keep copies of every user's
keys, a system called "key escrow" and, later, "key recovery". Viewed in
retrospect, the actual purpose of these proposals was to provide NSA with
a single (or very few) point(s) of access to keys, enabling them to continue
to access private and commercial
communications.</FONT></FONT><A NAME="_Toc448565549"></A>

<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>84. Between 1993 to 1998, the United States
conducted sustained diplomatic activity seeking to persuade EU nations and
the OECD to adopt their "key recovery" system. Throughout this period, the
US government insisted that the purpose of the initiative was to assist law
enforcement agencies. Documents obtained for this study suggest that these
claims wilfully misrepresented the true intention of US policy. Documents
obtained under the US Freedom of Information Act indicate that policymaking
was led exclusively by NSA officials, sometimes to the complete exclusion
of police or judicial officials. For example, when the specially appointed
US "Ambassador for Cryptography", David Aaron, visited Britain on 25 November
1996, he was accompanied and briefed by NSA's most senior representative
in Britain, Dr James J Hearn, formerly Deputy Director of NSA. Mr Aaron had
did not meet or consult FBI officials attached to his Embassy. His meeting
with British Cabinet officials included NSA's representative and staff from
Britain's GCHQ, but police officers or justice officials from both nations
were excluded.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>85. Since 1993, unknown to European
parliamentary bodies and their electors, law enforcement officials from many
EU countries and most of the UKUSA nations have been meeting annually in
a separate forum to discuss their requirements for intercepting communications.
These officials met under the auspices of a hitherto unknown organisation,
ILETS (International Law Enforcement Telecommunications Seminar). ILETS was
initiated and founded by the FBI. Table 2 lists ILETS meetings held between
1993 and 1997.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>86. At their 1993 and 1994 meetings, ILETS
participants specified law enforcement user requirements for communications
interception. These appear in a 1974 ILETS document called "IUR 1.0". This
document was based on an earlier FBI report on "Law Enforcement Requirements
for the Surveillance of Electronic Communications", first issued in July
1992 and revised in June 1994. The IUR requirement differed little in substance
from the FBI's requirements but was enlarged, containing ten requirements
rather than nine. IUR did not specify any law enforcement need for "key escrow"
or "key recovery". Cryptography was mentioned solely in the context of network
security arrangements.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>87. Between 1993 and 1997 police representatives
from ILETS were not involved in the NSA-led policy making process for "key
recovery", nor did ILETS advance any such proposal, even as late as 1997.
Despite this, during the same period the US government repeatedly presented
its policy as being motivated by the stated needs of law enforcement agencies.
At their 1997 meeting in Dublin, ILETS did not alter the IUR. It was not
until 1998 that a revised IUR was prepared containing requirements in respect
of cryptography. It follows from this that the US government misled EU and
OECD states about the true intention of its policy.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>88. This US deception was, however, clear
to the senior Commission official responsible for information security. In
September 1996, David Herson, head of the EU Senior Officers' Group on
Information Security, stated his assessment of the US "key recovery" project

<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>89. It should be noted that technically,
legally and organisationally, law enforcement requirements for communications
interception differ fundamentally from communications intelligence. Law
enforcement agencies (LEAs) will normally wish to intercept a specific line
or group of lines, and must normally justify their requests to a judicial
or administrative authority before proceeding. In contract, Comint agencies
conduct broad international communications "trawling" activities, and operate
under general warrants. Such operations do not require or even suppose that
the parties they intercept are criminals. Such distinctions are vital to
civil liberty, but risk being eroded it the boundaries between law enforcement
and communications intelligence interception becomes blurred in
future.</FONT></FONT> <BR>

companies in any of the UKUSA countries are able to task Comint collection
to suit their private purposes. They do not have to. Each UKUSA country
authorises national level intelligence assessment organisations and relevant
individual ministries to task and receive economic intelligence from Comint.
Such information may be collected for myriad purposes, such as: estimation
of future essential commodity prices; determining other nation's private
positions in trade negotiations; monitoring international trading in arms;
tracking sensitive technology; or evaluating the political stability and/or
economic strength of a target country. Any of these targets and many others
may produce intelligence of direct commercial relevance. The decision as

<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>106. Since the mid-1990s, communications
intelligence agencies have faced substantial difficulties in maintaining
global access to communications systems. These difficulties will increase
during and after 2000. The major reason is the shift in telecommunications
to high capacity optical fibre networks. Physical access to cables is required
for interception. Unless a fibre network lies within or passes through a
collaborating state, effective interception is practical only by tampering
with optoelectronic repeaters (when installed). This limitation is likely
to place many foreign land-based high capacity optical fibre networks beyond
reach. The physical size of equipment needed to process traffic, together
with power, communications and recording systems, makes clandestine activity
impractical and risky.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>107. Even where access is readily available
(such as to COMSATs), the proliferation of new systems will limit collection
activities, partly because budgetary constraint will restrict new deployments,
and partly because some systems (for example, Iridium) cannot be accessed
by presently available systems.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>108. In the past 15 years the substantial
technological lead in computers and information technology once enjoyed by
Comint organisations has all but disappeared. Their principal computer systems
are bought "off the shelf" and are the equal of or even inferior to those
used by first rank industrial and academic organisations. They differ only
in being "TEMPEST shielded", preventing them emitting radio signals which
could be used to analyse Sigint activity.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>109. Communications intelligence organisations
recognise that the long war against civil and commercial cryptography has
been lost. A thriving academic and industrial community is skilled in
cryptography and cryptology. The Internet and the global marketplace have
created a free flow in information, systems and software. NSA has failed
in its mission to perpetuate access by pretending that that "key escrow"
and like systems were intended to support law enforcement (as opposed to
Comint) requirements.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>110. Future trends in Comint are likely
to include limits on investment in Comint collection from space; greater
use of human agents to plant collection devices or obtain codes than in the
past; and an intensified effort to attack foreign computer systems, using
the Internet and other means (in particular, to gain access to protected
files or communications before they are encrypted).</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>111. Attempts to restrict cryptography have
nevertheless delayed the large-scale introduction of effective cryptographic
security systems. The reduced cost of computational power has also enabled
Comint agencies to deploy fast and sophisticated processing and sorting
tools.</FONT></FONT>

in-depth understanding of present and future Comint
capabilities.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>2.&nbsp; At the technical level, protective
measures may best be focused on defeating hostile Comint activity by denying
access or, where this is impractical or impossible, preventing processing
of message content and associated traffic information by general use of
cryptography.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>3.&nbsp; As the SOGIS group within the
Commission has
recognised,</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_74_">(74)</A><FONT face="Arial"><FONT
    size=-1> the contrasting interests of states is a complex issue. Larger states
have made substantial investments in Comint capabilities. One member state
is active in the UKUSA alliance, whilst others are either "third parties"
to UKUSA or have made bilateral arrangements with NSA. Some of these arrangements
were a legacy of the cold war; others are enduring. These issues create internal
and international conflicts of interest. Technical solutions are not obvious.
It should be possible to define a shared interest in implementing measures
to defeat future external Comint activities directed against European states,
their citizens and commercial activities.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>4.&nbsp; A second area of apparent conflict
concerns states' desires to provide communications interception for legitimate
law enforcement purposes. The technical and legal processes involved in providing
interception for law enforcement purpose differ fundamentally from those
used in communications intelligence. Partly because of the lack of parliamentary
and public awareness of Comint activities, this distinction is often glossed
over, particularly by states that invest heavily in Comint. Any failure to
distinguish between legitimate law enforcement interception requirements
and interception for clandestine intelligence purposes raises grave issues
for civil liberties. A clear boundary between law enforcement and "national
security" interception activity is essential to the protection of human rights
and fundamental freedoms.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>5.&nbsp; At the present time, Internet browsers
and other software used in almost every personal computer in Europe is
deliberately disabled such that "secure" communications they send can, if
collected, be read without difficulty by NSA. US manufacturers are compelled
to make these arrangements under US export rules. A level playing field is
important. Consideration could be given to a countermeasure whereby, if systems
with disabled cryptographic systems are sold outside the United States, they
should be required to conform to an "open standard" such that third parties
and other nations may provide additional applications which restore the level
of security to at least enjoyed by domestic US customers.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>6.&nbsp; The work of ILETS has proceeded
for 6 years without the involvement of parliaments, and in the absence of
consultation with the industrial organisations whose vital interests their
work affects. It is regrettable that, prior to the publication of this report,
public information has not been available in states about the scope of the
policy-making processes, inside and outside the EU, which have led to the
formulation of existing and new law enforcement "user requirements". As a
matter of urgency, the current policy-making process should be made open
to public and parliamentary discussion in member states and in the EP, so
that a proper balance may be struck between the security and privacy rights
of citizens and commercial enterprises, the financial and technical interests
of communications network operators and service providers, and the need to
support law enforcement activities intended to suppress serious crime and
terrorism.</FONT></FONT><A NAME="Annexe"></A> <BR>

<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>1. From 1950 until the early 1980s, high
capacity multi-channel analogue communications systems were usually engineered
using separate communications channels carried at different frequencies The
combined signal, which could include 2,000 or more speech channels, was a
"multiplex". The resulting "frequency division multiplex" (FDM) signal was
then carried on a much higher frequency, such as by a microwave radio
signal.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>2. Digital communications have almost
universally taken over from analogue methods. The basic system of digital
multi-channel communications is time division multiplexing (TDM). In a TDM
telephony system, the individual conversational channels are first digitised.
Information concerning each channel is then transmitted sequentially rather
than simultaneously, with each link occupying successive time
"slots".</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>3. Standards for digital communications
evolved separately within Europe and North America. In the United States,
the then dominant public network carrier (the Bell system, run by AT&amp;T)
established digital data standards. The basic building block, a T-1 link,
carries the equivalent of 24 telephone channels at a rate of 1.544 Mbps.
Higher capacity systems operate at greater data transmission rates Thus,
the highest transmission rate, T-5, carries the equivalent of 8,000 speech
channels at a data rate of 560 Mbps.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>4. Europe adopted a different framework
for digital communications, based on standards originally agreed by the CEPT.
The basic European standard digital link, E-1, carries 30 telephone channels
at a data rate of 2 Mbps. Most European telecommunications systems are based
on E-1 links or (as in North America), multiples thereof. The distinction
is significant because most Comint processing equipment manufactured in the
United States is designed to handle intercepted communications working to
the European forms of digital communications.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>5. Recent digital systems utilise synchronised
signals carried by very high capacity optical fibres. Synchronising signals
enables single channels to be easily extracted from high capacity links.
The new system is known in the US as the synchronous optical network (SONET),
although three equivalent definitions and labels are in
use.</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_75_">(75)</A><A NAME="_Toc448565565"></A>

US corporations, such as Lockheed Martin, Space Systems/Loral, TRW, Raytheon
and Bendix are also contracted by NSA to operate major Sigint collection
sites. A full report on their products and services is beyond the scope of
this study. The state of the art in contemporary communications intelligence

<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>8. Wideband (or broadband) signals are normally
intercepted from satellites or tapped cables in the form of multiplex microwave
or high frequency signals. The first step in processing such signals for
Comint purposes is "wideband extraction". An extensive range of Sigint equipment
is manufactured for this purpose, enabling newly intercepted systems to be
surveyed and analysed. These include transponder survey equipment which identify
and classify satellite downlinks, demodulators, decoders, demultiplexers,
microwave radio link analysers, link survey units, carrier analysis systems,
and many other forms of hardware and software.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>9. A newly intercepted communications satellite
or data link can be analysed using the AST Model 196 "Transponder
characterisation system". Once its basic communications structure has been
analysed, the Model 195 "Wideband snapshot analyser", also known as SNAPPER,
can record sample data from even the highest capacity systems, sufficient
to analyse communications in minute detail. By the start of 1999, operating
in conjunction with the Model 990 "Flexible Data Acquisition Unit", this
systems was able to record, playback and analyse at data rates up to 2.488
Gbps (SONET OC-48). This is 16 times faster than the largest backbone links
in general use on the Internet; larger than the telephony capacity of any
current communications satellite; and equivalent to 40,000 simultaneous telephone
calls. It can be fitted with 48 Gbyte of memory (500-1000 times larger than
found in an average personal computer), enabling relatively lengthy recordings
of high-speed data links. The 2.5 Gbps capacity of a single SNAPPER unit
exceeds the current daily maximum data rate found on a typical large Internet
exchange.</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_77_">(77)</A>

<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>11. Once communications links have been
analysed and broken down to their constituent parts, the next stage of Comint
collection involves multi-channel processors which extract and filter messages
and signals from the desired channels. There are three broad categories of
interest: "voice grade channels", normally carrying telephony; fax
communications; and analogue data modems. A wide selection of multi-channel
Comint processors are available. Almost all of them separate voice, fax and
data messages into distinct "streams" for downstream processing and
analysis.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>12. The AST Model 120 multi-channel processor
- used by NSA in different configurations known as STARQUAKE, COBRA and
COPPERHEAD - can handle 1,000 simultaneous voice channels and automatically
extract fax, data and voice traffic. Model 128, larger still, can process
16 European E-3 channels (a data rate of 500 Mbps) and extract 480 channels
of interest. The 1999 giant of AST's range, the Model 132 "Voice Channel
Demultiplexer", can scan up to 56,700 communications channels, extracting

sophisticated workstations using special purpose software. AST's ELVIRA Signals

which can be used on a laptop computer in covert locations, surveys incoming
channels and extracts standard Comint data, including technical specifications
(STRUM) and information about call destinations (SRI, or signal related

to have been designed with a view to analysing ATM (asynchronous transfer

system. It is better suited than standard Internet connections to carrying

involves automatic "optical character recognition" (OCR) software. This turns
the typescript into computer readable (and processable) text.
The</FONT><FONT size=+2> </FONT><FONT size=-1>effectiveness of these systems
makes fax-derived Comint an important collection subsystem. It has one drawback.
OCR computer systems that can reliably recognise handwriting do not exist.
No one knows how to design such a system. It follows that, perversely,
hand-written fax messages may be a secure form of communication that can
evade Dictionary surveillance criteria, provided always that the associated
"signal related information" (calling and receiving fax numbers) have not
been recognised as being of interest and directed to a Fax Image
Workstation.</FONT></FONT>

teleconferencing sessions. Sigint systems to intercept cellular mobile phone
networks such as GSM are not advertised by AST or IDEAS, but are available
from other US contractors. The specifications and ready availability of such
systems indicate how industrialised and pervasive Comint has became. It has
moved far from the era when (albeit erroneously), it was publicly associated
only with monitoring diplomatic or military messages.</FONT></FONT>

intelligence from signal related information, such as the number dialled
on a telephone call, or the Calling Line Identification Data (CLID) which
identifies the person making the call. Traffic analysis can be used where
message content is not available, for example when encryption is used. By

<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>20. Whenever machine readable communications
are available, keyword recognition is fundamental to Dictionary computers,
and to the ECHELON system. The Dictionary function is straightforward. Its

to perform very high speed sorting of large volumes of intercepted information.
In the late 1980s, the manufacturers of the RHYOLITE Sigint satellites, TRW,

FDF chip was declassified in 1972 and made available for commercial use by
a spin-off company, Paracel. Since then Paracel has sold over 150 information
filtering systems, many of them to the US government. Paracel describes its
current FDF technology as the "fastest, most accurate adaptive filtering

<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>23. Powerful though Dictionary methods and
keyword search engines may be, however, they and their giant associated
intelligence databases may soon seem archaic. Topic analysis is a more powerful
and intuitive technique, and one that NSA is developing and promoting with
confidence. Topic analysis enables Comint customers to ask their computers
to "find me documents about subject X". X might be "Shakespeare in love"
or "Arms to Iran".</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>24. In a standard US test used to evaluate
topic analysis
systems,</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_83_">(83)</A><FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>
one task the analysis program is given is to find information about "Airbus
subsidies". The traditional approach involves supplying the computer with
the key terms, other relevant data, and synonyms. In this example, the
designations A-300 or A-320 might be synonymous with "Airbus". The disadvantage
of this approach is that it may find irrelevant intelligence (for example,
reports about export subsidies to goods flown on an Airbus) and miss relevant
material (for example a financial analysis of a company in the consortium
which does not mention the Airbus product by name). Topic analysis overcomes
this and is better matched to human intelligence.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>25. The main detectable thrust of NSA research
on topic analysis centres on a method called N-gram analysis. Developed inside
NSA's Research group - responsible for Sigint automation - N-gram analysis
is a fast, general method of sorting and retrieving machine-readable text
according to language and/or topic. The N-gram system is claimed to work
independently of the language used or the topic studied. NSA patented the
method in 1995.</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_84_">(84)</A>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>26. To use N-gram analysis, the operator
ignores keywords and defines the enquiry by providing the system with selected
written documents concerning the topic of interest. The system determines
what the topic is from the seed group of documents, and then calculates the
probability that other documents cover the same topic. In 1994, NSA made
its N-gram system available for commercial exploitation. NSA's research group
claimed that it could be used on "very large data sets (millions of documents)",
could be quickly implemented on any computer system and that it could operate
effectively "in text containing a great many errors (typically 10-15% of
all characters)".</FONT></FONT>

<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>28. For more than 40 years, NSA, ARPA, GCHQ
and the British government Joint Speech Research Unit have conducted and
sponsored research into speech recognition. Many press reports (and the previous
STOA report) have suggested that such research has provided systems which
can automatically select telephone communications of intelligence interest
based on the use of particular "key words" by a speaker. If available, such
systems would enable vastly more extensive Comint information to be gathered
from telephone conversations than is available from other methods of analysis.
The contention that telephone word-spotting systems are readily available
appears to by supported by the recent availability of a string of low-cost
software products resulting from this research. These products permit PC
users to dictate to their computers instead of entering data through the
keyboard. </FONT></FONT><A href="#N_86_">(86)</A>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>29. The problem is that for Comint applications,
unlike personal computer dictation products, speech recognition systems have
to operate in a multi-speaker, multi-language environment where numerous
previously never heard speakers may each feature physiological differences,
dialect variations, and speech traits. Commercial PC systems usually require
one or more hours of training in order reliably to recognise a single speaker.
Even then, such systems may mistranscribe 10% or more of the words
spoken.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>30. In PC dictation applications, the speaker
can correct mistranscriptions and continually retrain the recognition system,
making a moderate error rate acceptable. For use in Comint, where the
interception system has no prior knowledge of what has been said (or even
the language in use), and has to operate in the poorer signal environment
of a telephone speech channel, such error rates are unachievable. Worse still,
even moderate error rates can make a keyword recognition system worthless
by generating both false positive outputs (words wrongly identified as keywords)
and false negative outputs (missing genuine keywords).</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>31. This study has found no evidence that
voice keyword recognition systems are currently operationally deployed, nor
that they are yet sufficiently accurate to be worth using for intelligence
purposes.</FONT></FONT>

<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>32. The fundamental technique in many speech
recognition applications is a statistical method called Hidden Markov Modelling
(HMM). HMM systems have been developed at many centres and are claimed
academically to offer "good word spotting performance ... using very little
or no acoustic speech
training".</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_87_">(87)</A><FONT face="Arial"><FONT
    size=-1> The team which reported this result tested its system using data
from the US Department of Defense "Switchboard Data", containing recordings
of thousand of different US telephone conversations. On a limited test the
probabilities of correctly detecting the occurrences of 22 keywords ranged
from 45-68% on settings which allowed for 10 false positive results per keyword
per hour. Thus if 1000 genuine keywords appeared during an hour's conversation,
there would be at least 300 missed key words, plus 220 false
alarms.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>33. At about the same time, (February 1990),
the Canadian Sigint organisation CSE awarded a Montreal-based computer research
consultancy the first of a series of contracts to develop a Comint wordspotting
system.</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_88_">(88)</A><FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>
The goal of the project was to build a word-spotter that worked well even
for noisy calls. Three years later, CRIM reported that "our experience has
taught us that, regardless of the environmental conditions, wordspotting
remains a difficult problem". The key problem, which is familiar to human
listeners, is that a single word heard on its own can easily be misinterpreted,
whereas in continuous speech the meaning may be deduced from surrounding
words. CRIM concluded in 1993 that "it is probable that the most effective
way of building a reliable wordspotter is to build a large vocabulary continuous
speech recognition (CSR) system".</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>34. Continuous speech recognition software
working in real time needs a powerful fast, processor. Because of the lack
of training and the complex signal environment found in intercepted telephone
calls, it is likely that even faster processors and better software than
used in modern PCs would yield poorer results than are now provided by
well-trained commercial systems. Significantly, an underlying problem is
that voice keyword recognition is, as with machine-readable messages, an
imperfect means to the more useful intelligence goal - topic
spotting.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>35. In 1993, having failed to build a workable
wordspotter, CRIM suggesting "bypassing" the problem and attempting instead
to develop a voice topic spotter. CRIM reported that "preliminary experiments
reported at a recent meeting of American defense contractors ... indicate
that this may in fact be an excellent approach to the problem". They offered
to produce an "operational topic spotting" system by 1995. They did not succeed.
Four years later, they were still experimenting on how to built a voice topic
spotter.</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_89_">(89)</A><FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>
They received a further research contract. One method CRIM proposed was NSA's
N-gram technique.</FONT></FONT>

<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>36. In 1993, CRIM also undertook to supply
CSE with an operational speaker identification module by March 1995. Nothing
more was said about this project, suggesting that the target may have been
met. In the same year, according to NSA documents, the IDEAS company supplied
a "Voice Activity Detector and Analyser", Model TE464375-1, to NSA's offices
inside GCHQ Cheltenham. The unit formed the centre of a 14-position computer
driven voice monitoring system. This too may have been an early speaker
identification system.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>37. In 1995, widely quoted reports suggested
that NSA speaker identification had been used to help capture the drug cartel
leader Pablo Escobar. The reports bore strong resemblance to a novel by Tom
Clancy, suggesting that the story may have owed more to Hollywood than high
tech. In 1997, the Canadian CRE awarded a contract to another researcher
to develop "new retrieval algorithms for speech characteristics used for
speaker identification", suggesting this method was not by then a fully mature
technology. According to Sigint staff familiar with the current use of
Dictionary, it can be programmed to search to identify particular speakers
on telephone channels. But speaker identification is still not a particularly
reliablr or effective Comint
technique.</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_90_">(90)</A>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>38. In the absence of effective wordspotting
or speaker identification techniques, NSA has sought alternative means of
automatically analysing telephone communications. According NSA's classification
guide, other techniques examined include Speech detection - detecting the
presence or absence of speech activity; Speaker discrimination - techniques
to distinguish between the speech of two or more speakers; and Readability
estimation - techniques to determine the quality of speech signals. System
descriptions must be classified "secret" if NSA "determines that they represent
major advances over techniques known in the research
community".</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_91_">(91)</A><A NAME="_Toc448565572"></A>

</UL>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>39. From the 1940s to date, NSA has undermined
the effectiveness of cryptographic systems made or used in Europe. The most
important target of NSA activity was a prominent Swiss manufacturing company,
Crypto AG. Crypto AG established a strong position as a supplier of code
and cypher systems after the second world war. Many governments would not
trust products offered for sale by major powers. In contrast, Swiss companies
in this sector benefited from Switzerland's neutrality and image of
integrity.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>40. NSA arranged to rig encryption systems
sold by Crypto AG, enabling UKUSA agencies to read the coded diplomatic and
military traffic of more than 130 countries. NSA's covert intervention was
arranged through the company's owner and founder Boris Hagelin, and involved
periodic visits to Switzerland by US "consultants" working for NSA. One was
Nora L MacKabee, a career NSA employee. A US newspaper obtained copies of
confidential Crypto AG documents recording Ms Mackebee's attendance at discussion
meetings in 1975 to design a new Crypto AG
machine".</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_92_">(92)</A>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>41. The purpose of NSA's interventions were
to ensure that while its coding systems should appear secure to other
cryptologists, it was not secure. Each time a machine was used, its users
would select a long numerical key, changed periodically. Naturally users
wished to selected their own keys, unknown to NSA. If Crypto AG's machines
were to appear strong to outside testers, then its coding system should work,
and actually be strong. NSA's solution to this apparent condundrum was to
design the machine so that it broadcast the key it was using to listeners.
To prevent other listeners recognising what was happening, the key too had
also to be sent in code - a different code, known only to NSA. Thus, every
time NSA or GCHQ intercepted a message sent using these machines, they would
first read their own coded part of the message, called the "hilfsinformationen"
(help information field) and extract the key the target was using. They could
then read the message itself as fast or even faster than the intended
recipient</FONT></FONT><A href="#N_93_">(93)</A>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>42. The same technique was re-used in 1995,
when NSA became concerned about cryptographic security systems being built
into Internet and E-mail software by Microsoft, Netscape and Lotus. The companies
agreed to adapt their software to reduce the level of security provided to
users outside the United States. In the case of Lotus Notes, which includes
a secure e-mail system, the built-in cryptographic system uses a 64 bit
encryption key. This provides a medium level of security, which might at
present only be broken by NSA in months or years.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>43. Lotus built in an NSA "help information"
trapdoor to its Notes system, as the Swedish government discovered to its
embarrassment in 1997. By then, the system was in daily use for confidential
mail by Swedish MPs, 15,000 tax agency staff and 400,000 to 500,000 citizens.
Lotus Notes incorporates a "workfactor reduction field" (WRF) into all e-mails
sent by non US users of the system. Like its predecessor the Crypto AG "help
information field" this device reduces NSA's difficulty in reading European
and other e-mail from an almost intractable problem to a few seconds work.
The WRF broadcasts 24 of the 64 bits of the key used for each communication.
The WRF is encoded, using a "public key" system which can only be read by
NSA. Lotus, a subsidiary of IBM, admits this. The company told Svenska
Dagbladet:</FONT></FONT>

<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>44. Similar arrangements are built into
all export versions of the web "browsers" manufactured by Microsoft and Netscape.
Each uses a standard 128 bit key. In the export version, this key is not
reduced in length. Instead, 88 bits of the key are broadcast with each message;
40 bits remain secret. It follows that almost every computer in Europe has,
as a built-in standard feature, an NSA workfactor reduction system to enable
NSA (alone) to break the user's code and read secure messages.</FONT></FONT>
<P>
<FONT face="Arial"><FONT size=-1>45. The use of powerful and effective encryption
systems will increasingly restrict the ability of Comint agencies to process
collected intelligence. "Moore's law" asserts that the cost of computational
power halves every 18 months. This affects both the agencies and their targets.
Cheap PCs can now efficiently perform complex mathematical calculations need
for effective cryptography. In the absence of new discoveries in physics
or mathematics Moore's law favours codemakers, not
codebreakers.</FONT></FONT> <BR>

In 1919, US commercial cable companies attempted to resist British government
demands for access to all cables sent overseas. Three cable companies testified
to the US Senate about these practices in December 1920. In the same year,
the British Government introduced legislation (the Official Secrets Act,
1920, section 4) providing access to all or any specified class of
communications. The same power was recodified in 1985, providing lawful access
for Comint purposes to all "external communications", defines as any
communications which are sent from or received outside the UK (Interception
of Communication Act 1984, Section 3(2)). Similar requirements on
telecommunications operators are made in the laws of the other UKUSA countries.

arrangements appears to be an attempt to comply with legal restrictions in
the Interception of Communications Act 1985, which prohibit GCHQ from handling
messages except those identified in government "certificates" which "describe
the intercepted material which should be examined". The Act specifies that
"so much of the intercepted material as is not certified by the certificate
is not [to be] read, looked at or listened to by any person". It appears
from this that, although all messages passing through the United Kingdom
are intercepted and sent to GCHQ's London office, the organisation considers
that by having British Telecom staff operate the Dictionary computer, it
is still under the control of the telecommunications network operator unless
and until it is selected by the Dictionary and passes from BT to
GCHQ.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
